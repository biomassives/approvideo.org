Because it solves the biggest problem of horizontal wind turbines, which have to be switched off during storms. Otherwise, they would completely destroy themselves, as the rotational mass would literally tear it apart. And no one wants such a projectile placed in the garden or house roof. Now picture this: a brilliant aesthetic vertical wind turbine for a home that can operate even at Category 4 hurricanes! A home wind turbine that consistently delivers power with little to no maintenance for over 20 years! It's designed to resist the harshest weather conditions, such as snow, ice, and sand storms. That's the promise of the Icewind turbine! It enables energy independence and living off the grid. It requires little space, is easy to install, and is a perfect complement to solar panels, especially when less sunlight is available at night and during the dark and cloudy season. But what makes this wind turbine so unique? And is an Investment really worthwhile for home users? Let´s Find out in today's video",
